Smart city hackathon final code. An android app to report public issues to the municipal body

## Smart India Hackathon
> In a developing country like India we face a lot of public issue like street light failure, dirty streets, water leakage on streets, transformer failure. This system to issue a complaint is inefficient and time consuming.

### Solution:
- We the students of **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham** have developed an android app where
people can report problem through their smart phones. 

- When these problems are recorded systematically it is easy for the municipalities to keep
track of it and solve it.

- We use block chain technology to solve this problem which ensures that all reports are
available to the public
